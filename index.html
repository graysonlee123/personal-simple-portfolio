            My pipedream is for extraterrestrial contact; preferrably a ship
            coming to Earth. I'd settle for being a coloniser on Mars though.

            <p>
              Grayson is an extremely talented developer. I had the true
              pleasure to work with Grayson during a project, where he was
              responsible for our design, React components, and other Front end
              technologies. When handed a task, Grayson delivers and does so
              proficiently, asking for more that he can do. I would highly
              consider asking Grayson for help building my own personal
              websites.

            <p>
              Grayson has worked for me for years helping me run a state trade
              association for the retail jewelers here in Georgia. He doesn’t
              miss a deadline or disappoint me ever and often anticipates my
              needs. Grayson exhibits both creativity and excellent work ethics.
              Two other businesses are now very satisfied with his abilities
              after I sent him their way.

            <p>
              Grayson worked for me for almost 4 years. He handled all my
              customer's graphic design and print requests. He was excellent at
              listening to what my customers needed and creating a full
              complement of designs to fit their needs. I would highly recommend
              him as a great associate. He would be an asset to any company.
