        <h2>Testimonials</h2>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            Grayson is an extremely talented developer. I had the true
            pleasure to work with Grayson during a project, where he was
            responsible for our design, React components, and other Front end
            technologies. When handed a task, Grayson delivers and does so
            proficiently, asking for more that he can do. I would highly
            consider asking Grayson for help building my own personal
            websites.

          <p>
            Grayson has worked for me for years helping me run a state trade
            association for the retail jewelers here in Georgia. He doesn’t
            miss a deadline or disappoint me ever and often anticipates my
            needs. Grayson exhibits both creativity and excellent work ethics.
            Two other businesses are now very satisfied with his abilities
            after I sent him their way.

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            Grayson worked for me for almost 4 years. He handled all my
            customer's graphic design and print requests. He was excellent at
            listening to what my customers needed and creating a full
            complement of designs to fit their needs. I would highly recommend
            him as a great associate. He would be an asset to any company.
